         <h2><a name="Events"></a>What are events?</h2>
         <p>Events are essentially messages broadcast to all Lua classes in the game. They are triggered when key things happen in the game. A mod can listen to game events to have behavior happen at appropriate moments.</p>
         <p>Events have a target object and a target identifier key since all items of a certain class may want to listen on events relevant to that class, but only actually respond to events involving themselves or their children.</p>
         <p>You can listen to events triggered from the vanilla mods, or trigger your own custom events from your code and listen to them.</p>
         <h2><a name="Triggering"></a>Firing an event</h2>
         <p>To trigger an event, call <code>radiant.events.trigger_async()</code> and pass in an identifying object (usually the entity that the event concerns; if it's a general event, sometimes the service that relates to that event), the name of the event (namespaced to the mod in question) and an optional set of arguments:</p>
         <pre><code>  radiant.events.trigger_async(entity, 'stonehearth:admiring_fire', {})
</code></pre>
         <p>Note that the above function triggers events asynchronously. So when you catch the event, you should confirm the worldstate. You cannot, for example, assume that objects that existed when the event was fired still exist in the world. There's also <code>radiant.events.trigger_sync()</code> but firing the event as async is better for performance.</p>
         <h2><a name="Listening"></a>Listening to an event</h2>
         <p>If a class wishes to receive an event, it registers to listen on the identifying object/string key pair, and specifies the function to call when the event is fired.</p>
         <p>To listen on an event, call <code>radiant.events.listen()</code> and pass in an identifying object (should match the one that was passed into the trigger), the name of the event, and a function that should receive the arguments and be called when the event is triggered. For example:</p>
         <pre><code>  radiant.events.listen(entity, 'stonehearth:buff_added', function(e)
        --e has the arguments passed into the trigger
        if e.uri == uri then
           -- do stuff
        end
     end)
</code></pre>
         <p>Or you can pass in a function that exists elsewhere in the class:</p>
         <pre><code>  self._attribute_listener = radiant.events.listen(entity, 'stonehearth:foo_event', self, self._on_attribute_changed)

  function ClassName:_on_attribute_changed(e)
     --do stuff
  end
</code></pre>
         <h2><a name="Unlistening"></a>Unlistening to events</h2>
         <p>Destroy an event listener when you know it's no longer relevant, to save traffic on the event pipeline and prevent errors. Refer to it by the name you used to save it.</p>
         <p>If you no longer want to listen to an event, you can either return <strong>radiant.events.UNLISTEN</strong> in the callback function, or you can save the event and destroy it later:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <p>If you want to unlisten on the event that just fired, your function should just return <strong>radiant.events.UNLISTEN</strong> instead of unlistening directly, so the events can be counted correctly in the event service. Example of unlistening from the callback:</p>
               <pre><code>function ClassName:_on_attribute_changed()
   return radiant.events.UNLISTEN
end
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>If an object with a listener is still listening to an event at the time it's going to be destroyed, unlisten to the event. Example here assumes that the event was saved to <code>self._attribute_listener</code>, like in the example of the section above:</p>
               <pre><code>if self._attribute_listener then
   self._attribute_listener:destroy()
   self._attribute_listener = nil
end
</code></pre>
               <p>  This would normally be called in the <code>destroy()</code> function of the class.</p>
            </li>
         </ul>

            #List of Events
            
            All events listed below are prefaced in code by stonehearth:, because they are all part of the stonehearth mod.
            
            ##Time
            
               - **hourly** - triggered every in-game hour by the calendar service. Passes args: {now = self._sv.date}
                  - Key: stonehearth.calendar
                  - Args: {now = current date}
            
            For all the above events:
            
               - Key: stonehearth.calendar
               - Args: none
            
            Note: times of day (midnight, sunrise, noon, sunset are defined in calendar constants)
                  "event_times" : {
                     "midnight" : 0,
                     "sunrise" : 6,
                     "midday" : 14,
                     "sunset_start" : 20,
                     "sunset" : 22
                  }
            
            ##Combat
            
               - **combat:begin\_melee\_attack** - triggered whenever someone attacks another person in combat.
                  - Key: entity that is attacking
                  - Name: stonehearth:combat:begin\_melee\_attack
                  - Args: the combat context
               - **combat:melee\_attack\_connect** - triggered whenever an attackers blow hits the target. Passing the target's health means we can also tell if we've killed the target.
                  - Key: entity that is attacking
                  - Name: stonehearth:combat:melee\_attack\_connect
                  - Args: action_details - some data about the nature of the attack (attacker, target, damage, target_health, target_exp). Target_exp is exp per hit.
               - **combat:battery** - triggered whenever a person is hit in combat. Triggered by _combat\_service.lua_: radiant.events.trigger_async(target, 'stonehearth:combat:battery', context)
                  - Key: entity that was targeted
                  - Name: stonehearth:combat:battery
                  - Args: context (some details on combat action included, like attacker, target, etc)
            
            ##Death
            
               - **kill_event** - triggered whenever a significant entity is killed and needs to inform its components etc that it is being destroyed. Only use if you are a component or an object related to that eneity, and must clean yourself up before the entity is destroyed.
                  - Key: entity that was killed
                  - Name: stonehearth:kill_event
                  - Args: none
                  - Note: this is a synchronous event, so don't do anything crazy in the event handlers listening to it. On the flip side, you know the entity still exists. Please only use if you are a component on the entity and need to clean up after yourself. Otherwise, really complicated things can happen when a sync event goes off.
               - **entity_killed** - triggered when an entity of significance (a villager, an enemy) dies due to in-game causes. Like kill_event but is async, and should be used in preference to kill_event UNLESS you are a component or object related to the entity that must clean yourself up on its removal from the game.
                  - Key: radiant.entities
                  - Name: stonehearth:combat:entity_killed
                  - Args: entity - the name, id, faction, and player_id of the entity that died
                  - Note: this is async, so don't assume that the entity still exists.
