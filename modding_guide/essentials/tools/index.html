            <h1>Tools for modding</h1>
            <p>
            <h2>What tools do I need to make my mod?</h2>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Any text editor</strong>. You can use whichever editor you like, from Notepad, to Sublime. It's better if the text editor has features that help with programming, such as highlighting syntax, etc, but you can simply use the default editor that comes with Windows (Notepad).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That is the only required tool, actually, but depending on what your mod does, you will want more tools:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>If you want to add your own models to the game, you'll need a <strong>voxel editor</strong>. There are free ones, like <a href="https://ephtracy.github.io/">MagicaVoxel</a>, <a href="https://blackflux.com/node/11">VoxelShop</a> or <a href="http://guillaumechereau.github.io/goxel/">Goxel</a>; and paid ones like <a href="http://www.minddesk.com/">Qubicle</a>. It must have the option to export files in <em>.qb</em> format. Additionally, if you want to animate those models for the game, it'll need to have the option to export to another 3D format (.obj, etc.), and also be able to use "matrices" or different layers in the model, so that you can separate the different parts for animating.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For <strong>animation</strong>, you can use free programs like <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, or paid programs like <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/3ds-max">3ds Max</a> or <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/maya">Maya</a> (these ones have free versions too). You'll need some kind of add-on or plugin that allows for skeletons and animations to be exported to the JSON structure that the game uses.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For <strong>checking JSON syntax</strong>, there's a convenient online tool called <a href="https://jsonlint.com">JsonLint</a>, and there's also another tool for comparing the content of two JSON files: <a href="http://www.jsondiff.com/">Json Diff</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For <strong>faster mod creation</strong>, there's the official <a href="../../essentials/shed/index.html">SHED</a> (StoneHearth EDitor). It now includes a user-friendly particle effects editor, auto-complete for campaigns, and a recipes editor. It comes bundled in the game folder, at /stonehearth/shed/.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For easier <strong>translation</strong> of existing mods to other languages, there's a web option at <a href="https://brunosupremo.github.io/Stonehearth-Translator/">Stonehearth-Translator</a> or a downloadable app at <a href="https://discourse.stonehearth.net/t/tkhs-translation-helper-program-downloadable/5086">thk's tool</a>.</p>
                </li>
