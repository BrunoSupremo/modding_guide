         <h1>Changing the scale</h1>
         <p>It doesn't matter how big an object is when you model it compared with other objects in the game, because we can change its scale from its JSON file.</p>
         <p>If you don't specify the scale of an item, by default it's 0.1.</p>
         <p>Trees and boulders have a scale of 1 (defined in their mixins), which means that each of the voxels in their models occupies 1 terrain block (you can see the size of a terrain block by opening the zones menu or the building menu, a grid will be displayed on the terrain).</p>
         <p>Iconics are usually modeled with a size of 10x10x10 voxels, and since the default scale is 0.1, they fit perfectly in 1 block of terrain inside the game, which makes them align nicely in the stockpiles, and also fit in the hands of the hearthlings. Hearthlings themselves also have a 0.1 scale. Their face is 13 voxels wide, and you can see in the game that they barely occupy more than one terrain block of width.

         </p>
         <p>To change the scale of an object, we need to add the <strong>"render_info"</strong> component to its JSON file. For example, this is the wheat_pile_ghost.json file, which determines the aspect of a wheat pile once placed:</p>
         <pre><code>  {
     "mixins": "stonehearth:mixins:placed_object",
     "components": {
        "model_variants": {
           "default": {
              "models": [
                 "file(wheat_pile.qb)"
              ]
           }
        },
        "render_info": {
           "scale": 0.12
        },
        "mob": {
           "model_origin": { "x": -0.55, "y": 0, "z": 0.5 },
           "region_origin": { "x": 0.5, "y": 0, "z": 0.5 }
        }
     },
     "entity_data": {
        "stonehearth:catalog": {
           "display_name": "i18n(stonehearth:entities.containers.wheat_pile.display_name)",
           "description": "i18n(stonehearth:entities.containers.wheat_pile.description)",
           "icon": "file(wheat_pile.png)",
           "category": "storage",
           "material_tags": "stockpile_cooking_ingredient crafted wheat_pile resource_pile"
        }
     }
  }
</code></pre>
         <p>Inside the "render_info" component we say <strong>"scale" : 0.12</strong>, which will make the object look slightly larger than with the default scale.
            With this, we can make items smaller (e.g.: <strong>"scale" : 0.05</strong> - half as big as the default scale):
            <img src="/modding_guide/images/basic/adding_items/small_scale.png" alt="small_scale"/>
            or larger (e.g.: <strong>"scale" : 2</strong> - 20 times bigger than the default scale):
            <img src="/modding_guide/images/basic/adding_items/big_scale.png" alt="big_scale"/>
         </p>
         <p>The render_info component is also used for defining other properties such as animation tables, <a href="../../color_maps/index.html">color maps</a>, and <a href="../../color_maps/index.html#RenderMaterials">material maps</a>.</p>
         <p>We can also test this in game. Select an entity, open the <a href="../../../essentials/debugtools/debugtools_mod/index.html#LuaConsole">Lua console</a>, and type this:</p>
         <pre><code>  e:get_component('render_info'):set_scale(0.2)
</code></pre>
         <p>then press Enter. Once you know the exact value that you want the scale to be, edit it in the JSON file and save the changes.</p>
